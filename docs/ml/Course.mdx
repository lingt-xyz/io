## What is machine learning?

1. Sofeware perspective: machine learning is just an example-driven way to build programs.

1. Test-driven development perspective: machine learning is like a form of “automated test-driven development,” where the tests are written before the program is written.

1. Compiler toolchain perspective: 

1. Program template perspective:

1. Curve fitting perspective:

1. Statistical perspective:

1. Optimization perspective:

## Categories of machine learning

1. Supervised learning: Given (input, output) examples, learn a function that predicts correct outputs on new inputs.

1. Unsupervised learning: Given input examples only, discover ‘structure’ in the data that will be useful for some future task.

1. Semi-supervised learning:

1. Classification and regression

1. Structured learning

1. Reinforcement learning: Given an action space and a reward signal, learn a policy that predicts the action that will eventually maximize reward.

1. Activelearning

1. Transfer learning

1. Multi-task learning

1. Deeplearning

## Machine learning versus AI

- Machine learning is about automatically designing computer programs from examples of the desired program behaviour. Useful when we don’t know how to write such a program by hand.
- Artificial intelligence is about creating computer programs that mimic human cognitive abilities: reasoning, planning, dialogue, finding analogies, self-directed learning, etc.
- AI _relies_ on ML, because we have examples of human cognitive abilities yet we don’t know how to write such programs. ML does this automatically.
