title: Java SE v.s. Java EE

### Java Programming Language Platforms

* Java Platform, Standard Edition \(Java SE\)
* Java Platform, Enterprise Edition \(Java EE\)
* Java Platform, Micro Edition \(Java ME\)
* JavaFX

All Java platforms consist of a Java Virtual Machine \(VM\) and an application programming interface \(API\). 

* The Java Virtual Machine is a program, for a particular hardware and software platform, that runs Java technology applications. 
* An API is a collection of software components that you can use to create other software components or applications.

### **Java SE**

Java SE's API provides the core functionality of the Java programming language. It defines everything from the basic types and objects of the Java programming language to high-level classes.

In addition to the core API, the Java SE platform consists of a virtual machine, development tools, deployment technologies, and other class libraries and toolkits commonly used in Java technology applications.

### **Java EE**

The Java EE platform is **built on top of the Java SE platform**. The Java EE platform provides an API and runtime environment for developing and running large-scale, multi-tiered, scalable, reliable, and secure network applications.

### **Java ME**

The Java ME platform provides an API and a small-footprint virtual machine for running Java programming language applications on small devices, like mobile phones. The API is a **subset** of the Java SE API, along with special class libraries useful for small device application development.

### **JavaFX**

JavaFX is a platform for creating rich internet applications using a lightweight _**user-interface**_ API.
