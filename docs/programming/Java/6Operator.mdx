## Assignment Operator

The assignment operator "`=`" assigns the value on its right to the operand on its left:

```java
int cadence = 0;
int speed = 0;
int gear = 1;
```

## Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `+` | Additive operator \(also used for String concatenation\) |
| `-` | Subtraction operator |
| `*` | Multiplication operator |
| `/` | Division operator |
| `%` | Remainder operator |

## Unary Operators

| Operator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `+` | Unary plus operator; indicates positive value \(numbers are positive without this, however\) |
| `-` | Unary minus operator; negates an expression |
| `++` | Increment operator; increments a value by 1 |
| `--` | Decrement operator; decrements a value by 1 |
| `!` | Logical complement operator; inverts the value of a boolean |

## Relational Operators

| Operator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `==` | equal to |
| `!=` | not equal to |
| `>` | greater than |
| `>=` | greater than or equal to |
| `<` | less than |
| `<=` | less than or equal to |

## Conditional Operators

| Operator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `&&` | and |
| \|\| | or |

These operators exhibit "short-circuiting" behavior, which means that the second operand is evaluated only if needed.

### Ternary operator

`?:`is known as the ternary operator because it uses three operands.

If `someCondition` is `true`, assign the value of `value1` to `result`. Otherwise, assign the value of `value2` to `result`.

```java
result = someCondition ? value1 : value2;
```

## Type Comparison Operator

The `instanceof` operator compares an object to a specified type.

## Operation on bits

#### `~`

The unary bitwise complement operator "`~`" inverts a bit pattern.

1. it can be applied to any of the integral types, making every "0" a "1" and every "1" a "0". 
2. For example, a `byte` contains 8 bits; applying this operator to a value whose bit pattern is "00000000" would change its pattern to "11111111".

#### `<<`

The signed left shift operator "`<<`" shifts a bit pattern to the left, and the signed right shift operator "`>>`" shifts a bit pattern to the right. The bit pattern is given by the left-hand operand, and the number of positions to shift by the right-hand operand. The unsigned right shift operator "`>>>`" shifts a zero into the leftmost position, while the leftmost position after `">>"` depends on sign extension.

#### `&`

The bitwise `&` operator performs a bitwise AND operation.

#### `^`

The bitwise `^` operator performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation.

#### `|`

The bitwise `|` operator performs a bitwise inclusive OR operation.
