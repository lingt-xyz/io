---

## JRE

JRE: Java Runtime Environment. It includes

* the JVM,
* the core libraries,
* other additional components to _**run**_ applications and applets written in Java.

## JDK

JDK: Java Development Kit. It includes

* the JRE,
* set of API classes,
* Java compiler,
* Webstart,
* additional files needed to _**write**_ Java applets and applications.

## Comparison

* JDK is a superset of JRE; that is, JRE is a subset of JDK.
* JDK is for _**writing and running**_ Java applets and applications; JRE is for _**running**_ Java applets and applications.
