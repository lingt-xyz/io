## Overview

JavaScript language:
- has no concept of input or output
- designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment
    - most common host environment is the browser
    - but JavaScript interpreters can also be found in a huge list of other places
        - server-side environments such as Node.js
        - NoSQL databases like the open source Apache CouchDB
        - Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Photoshop
        - SVG images etc.
    - up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world
- multi-paradigm
- dynamic language
- supports object-oriented programming with object prototypes, instead of classes
- supports functional programming â€” because they are objects, functions may be stored in variables and passed around like any other object
