title: New or Make

[Why would I make() or new()?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9320862/why-would-i-make-or-new/9325620\#9325620")

Go has multiple ways of memory allocation and value initialization:

`&T{...}`, `&someLocalVar`, `new`, `make`

Allocation can also happen when creating composite literals.

`new` can be used to allocate values such as integers, `&int` is illegal:

```go
new(Point)
&Point{}      // OK
&Point{2, 3}  // Combines allocation and initialization

new(int)
&int          // Illegal

// Works, but it is less convenient to write than new(int)
var i int
&i
```

The difference between `new` and `make` can be seen by looking at the following example:

```go
p := new(chan int)   // p has type: *chan int
c := make(chan int)  // c has type: chan int
```

Suppose Go does not have `new` and `make`, but it has the built-in function `NEW`. Then the example code would look like this:

```go
p := NEW(*chan int)  // * is mandatory
c := NEW(chan int)
```

The `*` _would be mandatory_, so:

```go
new(int)        -->  NEW(*int)
new(Point)      -->  NEW(*Point)
new(chan int)   -->  NEW(*chan int)
make([]int, 10) -->  NEW([]int, 10)

new(Point)  // Illegal
new(int)    // Illegal
```

Yes, merging `new` and `make` into a single built-in function is possible. However, it is probable that a single built-in function would lead to more confusion among new Go programmers than having two built-in functions.

Considering all of the above points, it appears more appropriate for `new` and `make` to remain separate.
