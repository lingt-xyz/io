## Arithmetic

|Operator	|Name	|Types
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
|+	|sum	|integers, floats, complex values, strings
|-	|difference	|integers, floats, complex values
|*	|product	|integers, floats, complex values
|/	|quotient	|integers, floats, complex values
|%	|remainder	|integers
|&	|bitwise AND |integers
|\|	|bitwise OR	|integers
|^	|bitwise XOR |integers
|&^	|bit clear (AND NOT) |integers	
|<<	|left shift	|integer << unsigned integer
|>>	|right shift	|integer >> unsigned integer

:::caution
GO does provide implicit numberic conversions. ([why](https://golang.org/doc/faq#conversions))
So the following code would not work:
```go
x := 1
y := 1.0
c := x/y
```

## Bitwise operators

|Operation	|Result	|Description
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
|0011 & 0101	|0001	|Bitwise AND
|0011 \| 0101	|0111	|Bitwise OR
|0011 ^ 0101	|0110	|Bitwise XOR
|^0101			|1010	|Bitwise NOT (same as 1111 ^ 0101)
|0011 &^ 0101	|0010	|Bitclear (AND NOT)
|00110101<<2	|11010100	|Left shift
|00110101<<100	|00000000	|No upper limit on shift count
|00110101>>2	|00001101	|Right shift

## Comparison

|Operator	|Name	|Types
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
|==	|equal	|comparable
|!=	|not equal	|comparable
|<	|less	|integers, floats, strings
|<=	|less or equal	|integers, floats, strings
|>	|greater	|integers, floats, strings
|>=	|greater or equal	|integers, floats, strings

* Boolean, integer, floats, complex values and strings are comparable.
* Strings are ordered lexically byte-wise.
* Two pointers are equal if they point to the same variable or if both are nil.
* Two channel values are equal if they were created by the same call to make or if both are nil.
* Two interface values are equal if they have identical dynamic types and equal concrete values or if both are nil.
* A value x of non-interface type X and a value t of interface type T are equal if t’s dynamic type is identical to X and t’s concrete value is equal to x.
* Two struct values are equal if their corresponding non-blank fields are equal.
* Two array values are equal if their corresponding elements are equal.

## Logical

|Operator	|Name	|Types
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
|&&	|conditional AND	|p && q   means "if p then q else false"
|\|\|	|conditional OR	|p \|\| q   means "if p then true else q"
|!|	NOT	|!p   means "not p"

### Pointers and channels
|Operator	|Name	|Description
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
|&	|address of	|&x   generates a pointer to x
|*	|pointer indirection	|*x   denotes the variable pointed to by x
|<-	|receive	|<-ch   is the value received from channel ch
