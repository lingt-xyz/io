title: Goroutine
---

A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime.

```text
go f(x, y, z)
```

starts a new goroutine running `f(x, y, z)`. 

The evaluation of `f`, `x`, `y`, and `z` happens in the current goroutine and the execution of `f` happens in the new goroutine.

Goroutines run in the same address space, so access to shared memory must be synchronized. The [`sync`](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/) package provides useful primitives, although you won't need them much in Go as there are other primitives. \(See the next slide.\)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func say(s string) {
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
		fmt.Println(s)
	}
}

func main() {
	go say("world")
	say("hello")
}


/*
world
hello
hello
world
world
hello
hello
world
world
hello
*/
```
