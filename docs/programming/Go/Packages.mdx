Every Go program is made up of packages. Programs start running in package main.
By convention, the package name is the same as the last element of the import path.

> :information_source: For instance, the "math/rand"package comprises files that begin with the statement package `rand`.

``` go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("My favorite number is", rand.Intn(10))
}
```

### Imports

``` go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("Now you have %g problems.\n", math.Sqrt(7))
}
```

This code groups the imports into a parenthesized, "factored" import statement.
You can also write multiple import statements, like:

``` go
import "fmt"
import "math"
```

### Exported names

In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter. For example, `Pizza` is an exported name, as is `Pi`, which is exported from the `math` package.

`pizza` and `pi` do not start with a capital letter, so they are not exported.

When importing a package, you can refer only to its exported names. Any "unexported" names are not accessible from outside the package.

``` go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	//fmt.Println(math.pi)
	fmt.Println(math.Pi)
}
```
