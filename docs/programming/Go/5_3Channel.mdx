title: Channel
---

Channels are a typed conduit through which you can send and receive values with the channel operator, `<-`.

```text
ch <- v    // Send v to channel ch.
v := <-ch  // Receive from ch, and
           // assign value to v.
```

\(The data flows in the direction of the arrow.\)

Like maps and slices, channels must be created before use:

```text
ch := make(chan int)
```

By default, sends and receives block until the other side is ready. This allows goroutines to synchronize without explicit locks or condition variables.

The example code sums the numbers in a slice, distributing the work between two goroutines. Once both goroutines have completed their computation, it calculates the final result.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func sum(s []int, c chan int) {
	sum := 0
	for _, v := range s {
		sum += v
	}
	c <- sum // send sum to c
}

func main() {
	s := []int{7, 2, 8, -9, 4, 0}

	c := make(chan int)
	go sum(s[:len(s)/2], c)
	go sum(s[len(s)/2:], c)
	x, y := <-c, <-c // receive from c

	fmt.Println(x, y, x+y)
}


// -5 17 12
```

## Buffered Channels

Channels can be buffered. Provide the buffer length as the second argument to `make` to initialize a buffered channel:

```text
ch := make(chan int, 100)
```

Sends to a buffered channel block only when the buffer is full. Receives block when the buffer is empty.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	ch := make(chan int, 2)
	ch <- 1
	ch <- 2
	fmt.Println(<-ch)
	fmt.Println(<-ch)
}


/*
1
2
*/
```

Modify the example to overfill the buffer and see what happens.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	ch := make(chan int, 2)
	ch <- 1
	ch <- 2
	ch <- 3
	fmt.Println(<-ch)
	fmt.Println(<-ch)
}


// fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!
```

## Range and Close

A sender can `close` a channel to indicate that no more values will be sent. Receivers can test whether a channel has been closed by assigning a second parameter to the receive expression: after

```text
v, ok := <-ch
```

`ok` is `false` if there are no more values to receive and the channel is closed.

The loop `for i := range c` receives values from the channel repeatedly until it is closed.

**Note:** Only the sender should close a channel, never the receiver. Sending on a closed channel will cause a panic.

**Another note:** Channels aren't like files; you don't usually need to close them. Closing is only necessary when the receiver must be told there are no more values coming, such as to terminate a `range` loop.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func fibonacci(n int, c chan int) {
	x, y := 0, 1
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		c <- x
		x, y = y, x+y
	}
	close(c)
}

func main() {
	c := make(chan int, 10)
	go fibonacci(cap(c), c)
	for i := range c {
		fmt.Println(i)
	}
}


/*
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
*/
```
