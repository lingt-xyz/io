title: Method
---


Go does not have classes. However, you can define methods on types.

A method is a function with a special receiver argument.

The receiver appears in its own argument list between the `func` keyword and the method name.

## Method on struct types

In this example, the `Abs` method has a receiver of type `Vertex` named `v`.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y float64
}

func (v Vertex) Abs() float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{3, 4}
	fmt.Println(v.Abs())
}
```

## Methods are functions

Remember: a method is just a function with a receiver argument.

Here's `Abs` written as a regular function with no change in functionality.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y float64
}

func Abs(v Vertex) float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{3, 4}
	fmt.Println(Abs(v))
}

```

## Method on non-struct types

In this example we see a numeric type `MyFloat` with an `Abs` method.

You can only declare a method with a receiver whose type is defined in the same package as the method. You cannot declare a method with a receiver whose type is defined in another package \(which includes the built-in types such as `int`\).

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type MyFloat float64

func (f MyFloat) Abs() float64 {
	if f < 0 {
		return float64(-f)
	}
	return float64(f)
}

func main() {
	f := MyFloat(-math.Sqrt2)
	fmt.Println(f.Abs())
}
```

## Pointer receivers

You can declare methods with pointer receivers.

This means the receiver type has the literal syntax `*T` for some type `T`. \(Also, `T` cannot itself be a pointer such as `*int`.\)

For example, the `Scale` method here is defined on `*Vertex`.

Methods with pointer receivers can modify the value to which the receiver points \(as `Scale` does here\). Since methods often need to modify their receiver, pointer receivers are more common than value receivers.

Try removing the `*` from the declaration of the `Scale` function on line 16 and observe how the program's behavior changes.

With a value receiver, the `Scale` method operates on **a copy of the original `Vertex` value**. \(This is the same behavior as for any other function argument.\) The `Scale` method must have a pointer receiver to change the `Vertex` value declared in the `main` function.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y float64
}

func (v Vertex) Abs() float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
}

func (v *Vertex) Scale(f float64) {
	v.X = v.X * f
	v.Y = v.Y * f
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{3, 4}
	v.Scale(10)
	fmt.Println(v.Abs())
}


// 50
```

## Pointers and functions

Here we see the `Abs` and `Scale` methods rewritten as functions.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y float64
}

func Abs(v Vertex) float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
}

func Scale(v *Vertex, f float64) {
	v.X = v.X * f
	v.Y = v.Y * f
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{3, 4}
	Scale(&v, 10)
	fmt.Println(Abs(v))
}
```

Comparing the previous two programs, you might notice that **functions with a pointer argument** must take a pointer:

```text
var v Vertex
ScaleFunc(v, 5)  // Compile error!
ScaleFunc(&v, 5) // OK
```

while **methods with pointer receivers** take either a value or a pointer as the receiver when they are called:

```text
var v Vertex
v.Scale(5)  // OK
p := &v
p.Scale(10) // OK
```

For the statement `v.Scale(5)`, even though `v` is a value and not a pointer, the method with the pointer receiver is called automatically. That is, as a convenience, Go interprets the statement `v.Scale(5)` as `(&v).Scale(5)` since the `Scale` method has a pointer receiver.

The equivalent thing happens in the reverse direction.

Functions that take a value argument must take a value of that specific type:

```text
var v Vertex
fmt.Println(AbsFunc(v))  // OK
fmt.Println(AbsFunc(&v)) // Compile error!
```

while methods with value receivers take either a value or a pointer as the receiver when they are called:

```text
var v Vertex
fmt.Println(v.Abs()) // OK
p := &v
fmt.Println(p.Abs()) // OK
```
