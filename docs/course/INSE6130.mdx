## Introduction

### What is computer security?
* Physical security and information security

### Overview of all perspectives of system security

* Objectives
    * Confidentiality (Secrecy)
        * What: keeping data and resources hidden
        * How: encryption
    * Integrity
        * What: data integrity and origin integrity (authentication)
        * How: digital signature and ?
    * Availability (Denial of Service)
        * What: enabling access to data and resources

* Classes of Threats
    * Disclosure: snooping (sniffing) -> confidentiality
    * Deception: modification, spoofing (masquerading), repudiation of origin, denial of receipt -> Integrity
    * Disruptoin: modification -> Availability
    * Usurpation (take control of system): modification, spoofing, delay, denial of service -> confidentiality, integrity, availability

* Policies and Mechanisms
    * Policies define "security" for the system: what can do, what cannot do
        - Given by natural language, math, special languages
    * Mechanisms enforece policies
        - Technical or procedural
    * OM-AM (by Ravi Sandhu)
        * *O*bjective (policy): e.g. confidentiality
        * *M*odel: A model is an abstract conceptual description of the objective. e.g. ACM
        * *A*rchitecutre: How to implemente the model. e.g. Client-Server
        * *M*echanism: Mechanism is a low level implementation. e.g. Encryption

* Ways for achieving security
    * Prevention
        - Prevent attacks from violating security policy
        - Prevention not always work
    * Detection
    * Recovery
        - Stop attack, assess and repair damage
        - Continue to function correctly even if attack succeeds (e.g. Amazon cannot stop service to recover)

* Trust and assumptions
    * They underlie all aspects of security
    * For policies: unambiguously partiion system states, correctly capture security requirements
    * For mechanisms: assumed to enforce policy, work correctly

* Types of Mechanisms
    * Three cases
        - secure
        - precise
        - broad: some secure states are not reachable, some reachable states are not secure. This is the most common situation.
    * Policy should cover security.

* The role of trust, assurance, operational issues, human issues
    * Assurance
        * Specification: what is secure
            - Requirements analysis
            - Statement of desired functionality
        * Design
        * Implementatioin
    * Operational issues
        * Cost-Benefit analysis
            - Is it cheaper to prevent or to recover
        * Risk analysis
            * Should we protect something
            * How much should we protect is
        * Laws and Customs
    * Human Issues
        * Organizational Problems
            * Power and responsibility
            * Financial benefits
        * People problems
            * Outsiders and insiders
            * Social engineering: get information from person to go further

* How them tie together

## Access Control Matrix

> “How do I describe the security of any computer system… mathematically?”
    - So we have the Access Control Matrix model
    - Access control is who can do what to whom

### ACM (Access Control Matrix)

> Q: How to describe a system at any given time?

> A: Protection state of a system

1. What is state of a system: Collection of current settings and valus of a system. e.g.: values of memory locations, secondary storage, registers, and other components of an OS
2. What is protection state of a system: Subset of a state that is relevant to security. e.g.: access control settings (who can do what to whom)

> Q: How to mathematically represent a protection state?

> A: Access cnotrol matrix

1. ACM is a matrix describing rights of subjects over Objectives
1. ACM is an abstract model
    - Subject, object, and right could be anything
    - That's why it's powerful

### Definition of ACM

- Subjects: $$S=\{s_1, \ldots, s_n\}$$
- Objects: $$O=\{o_1, \ldots, o_m\}$$
- Rights: $$R=\{r_1, \ldots, r_k\}$$
- Matrix entries: $$A[s_i, o_j]\subseteq R$$
- Interpretation: $$A[s_i, o_j]=\{r_x,\ldots, r_y\}$$ means subject $$s_i$$ has rights $$r_x, \dots, r_y$$ over object $$o_j$$
- Object set always encloses subject set?

### Transition in ACM
### Safety question
### HRU result

## Foundational Results

> “Can I determine whether Can I determine whether any computer system is computer system is
secure?” (asked by *H*arrison *R*uzzo and *U*llman)
    - So we have the HRU result
