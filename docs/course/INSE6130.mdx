## Introduction

### What is computer security?
* Physical security and information security

### Overview of all perspectives of system security

* Objectives
    * Confidentiality (Secrecy)
        * What: keeping data and resources hidden
        * How: encryption
    * Integrity
        * What: data integrity and origin integrity (authentication)
        * How: digital signature and ?
    * Availability (Denial of Service)
        * What: enabling access to data and resources

* Classes of Threats
    * Disclosure: snooping(sniffing) -> confidentiality
    * Deception: modification, spoofing (masquerading), repudiation of origin, denial of receipt -> integrity
    * Disruptoin: modification -> availability
    * Usurpation(taking control of system): modification, spoofing, delay, denial of service -> confidentiality, integrity, availability

* Policies and Mechanisms
    * Policies define "security" for the system: what can do, what cannot do
        - Given by natural language, math, special languages
    * Mechanisms enforece policies
        - Technical or procedural
    * OM-AM (by Ravi Sandhu)
        * *O*bjective (policy): e.g. confidentiality
        * *M*odel: A model is an abstract conceptual description of the objective. e.g. ACM
        * *A*rchitecutre: How to implemente the model. e.g. Client-Server
        * *M*echanism: Mechanism is a low level implementation. e.g. Encryption

* Ways for achieving security
    * Prevention
        - Prevent attacks from violating security policy
        - Prevention not always work
    * Detection
    * Recovery
        - Stop attack, assess and repair damage
        - Continue to function correctly even if attack succeeds (e.g. Amazon cannot stop service to recover)

* Trust and assumptions
    * They underlie all aspects of security
    * For policies: unambiguously partiion system states, correctly capture security requirements
    * For mechanisms: assumed to enforce policy, work correctly

* Types of Mechanisms
    * Three cases
        - secure
        - precise
        - broad: some secure states are not reachable, some reachable states are not secure. This is the most common situation.
    * Policy should cover security.

* The role of trust, assurance, operational issues, human issues
    * Assurance
        * Specification: what is secure
            - Requirements analysis
            - Statement of desired functionality
        * Design
        * Implementatioin
    * Operational issues
        * Cost-Benefit analysis
            - Is it cheaper to prevent or to recover
        * Risk analysis
            * Should we protect something
            * How much should we protect is
        * Laws and Customs
    * Human Issues
        * Organizational Problems
            * Power and responsibility
            * Financial benefits
        * People problems
            * Outsiders and insiders
            * Social engineering: get information from person to go further

* How them tie together

## Access Control Matrix

> “How do I describe the security of any computer system… mathematically?”
    - So we have the Access Control Matrix model
    - Access control is who can do what to whom

### ACM (Access Control Matrix)

> Q: How to describe a system at any given time?

> A: Protection state of a system

1. What is state of a system: Collection of current settings and valus of a system. e.g.: values of memory locations, secondary storage, registers, and other components of an OS
2. What is protection state of a system: Subset of a state that is relevant to security. e.g.: access control settings (who can do what to whom)

> Q: How to mathematically represent a protection state?

> A: Access cnotrol matrix

1. ACM is a matrix describing rights of subjects over objectives
1. ACM is an abstract model
    - Subject, object, and right could be anything

### Definition of ACM

|            | $$o_1$$ | $$o_2$$       | $$\ldots$$ | $$o_m$$ | $$s_1$$ | $$s_2$$ | $$\dots$$ | $$s_n$$ |
|------------|---------|---------------|------------|---------|---------|---------|-----------|---------|
| $$s_1$$    | $$r_1$$ | $$r_1r_2$$    |            |         | $$r_3$$ |         |           |         |
| $$s_2$$    |         | $$r_3r_4r_5$$ | $$r_4$$    |         |         |         |           |         |
| $$\ldots$$ |         |               |            |         |         |         |           |         |
| $$s_n$$    |         |               |            |         |         |         |           |         |

- Subjects: $$S=\{s_1, \ldots, s_n\}$$
- Objects: $$O=\{o_1, \ldots, o_m\}$$
- Rights: $$R=\{r_1, \ldots, r_k\}$$
- Matrix entries: $$A[s_i, o_j]\subseteq R$$
- Interpretation: $$A[s_i, o_j]=\{r_x,\ldots, r_y\}$$ means subject $$s_i$$ has rights $$r_x, \dots, r_y$$ over object $$o_j$$
- **Object set always encloses subject set**

### Transition in ACM

- Why transition
    - The protection state of a system will change
    - Such change is modeled as ACM state transition
- Elements of transition
    - $$X_i$$ : ACM in the starting state
    - $$X_{i+1}$$: ACM in the ending state
    - Command $$\tau$$ : the action that causes this state transition
- Put it together: $$X_i \vdash_{\tau} X_{i+1}$$

#### Primitive Operations
Primitive Operations are the basic changes you can make to ACM.

- Create/destroy/enter/delete its elements:
    - create/destroy subject $$s$$
    - create/destroy object $$o$$
    - enter/delete $$r$$ into $$A[s, o]$$

#### Special Rights

- Copy
- Own

#### Command
Command is a fixed sequence of primitive operations.

- Command with Conditions
- Mono-operations Command
- Mono-conditional Command

:::note
Conditions cannot be negative or connected by "or"
:::

#### Principle of Attenuation of privilege

- One shouldn't be able to give out rights he/she does not posses except owner.
- The owner right implies all other rights.
    - Owner can give itself rights, then give the right to others, and finally delete its rights.

:::tip Question
Given an ACM and all the allowed commands, how to decide whether a subject will ever posses a right over an object?
:::
---

## Foundational Results

> “Can I determine whether Can I determine whether any computer system is computer system is
secure?” (asked by *H*arrison *R*uzzo and *U*llman)
    - So we have the HRU result

### Safety Problem
:::note
If a subject who does not initially possess a right $$r$$ can never obtain $$r$$, then the system is safe with respect to $$r$$ (legitimate delegation of $$r$$ are ignored).
:::

> Q: Can we write a program to decide the safety of any protection system?

> A: Safety problem is undecidable. (Special cases may be decidable)

#### Take-Grant Protection model
Take-Grant Protection model is a protection system with a specific set of commands. It decidable with a linear time complexity in the size of the system.

---

## Access Control Mechanism

ACM is good for theoretical study but bad for implementation.

### Access Control List(ACL)

An ACL stores the non-empty elements of each column with an object.

#TODO

- 'Closed World' assumption
    - Denied unless explicitly granted
- Identical rows
    - Use groups or wildcards to merge them
- Who can modify ACL? 
    - Creator of the file ACL or 
    - who have been granted modify right


### Capability Lists (C-List)

Rows or access control matrix stored with subjects.

#TODO

- The key challenge in implmentation is to prevent process/user from altering capabilities.
    - Kernel space versus User space
    - Put C-List inKernel space

### ACL versus C-Lists

- Equivalent in theory
- Differ in efficiency in answering
    - Which object can be accessed by a given subject? (C-List win)
    - What subjects can access a given object? (ACL win)

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

ACL/C-List full mapping would be too complicated, so introduce RBAC (Role).

:::info
Why role? Because rights usually depend on role (job function) instead of idenity.
:::


1. $$\text{RBAC}_{0}$$
    - Four sets: $$U, R, P, S$$
    - Two many-to-many relations $$UA, PA$$ (User assignments, Permission assignments)
        - $$US\subseteq U\times R$$
        - $$PA\subseteq P\times R$$
    - $$\text{user}(s)$$: which user does a session $s$ belong to
    - $$\text{roles}(s)$$: which roles the session $$s$$ has activated

1. $$\text{RBAC}_{1}$$: $$\text{RBAC}_{1}$$ = $$\text{RBAC}_{0}$$ + role hierarchy
    - If $$r_1\leq r_2$$ then
    1. Any user assigned to $$r_2$$ can activate $$r_1$$
    1. Activating $$r_2$$ gives user the all of $$r_1$$'s permissions

1. $$\text{RBAC}_{3}$$: $$\text{RBAC}_{3}$$ = $$\text{RBAC}_{1}$$ + constraints
    - No **_session_** can activate both TA and student

---

## Security Policies and Confidentiality Policies

Security Plicies are unambiguous statements.

### Define Security Policies

- Positive authorizations with the Closed World assumption
- Negative authorizations with the Open World assumption
- A mixture of the two, with conflicts resolution meta-policies

### Security Policty Defines Security

:::note
Under security policies, a 'secure' system is one that
1. Only starts from authorized states
2. Never enters any unauthorized states
:::

### Types of Security policy

1. Confidentiality policy
2. Integrity policy
3. Availability policy

Most applications require combinations of these.

### Types of Access Control Policies

1. Descretionary Access Control (DAC)
    - Access is based on owner's discretionary
    - Standard Unix security
2. Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
    - System controls accesses and users cannot alter


### Lattice

- LUB: least upper bound
- GLB: greatest lower bound
- Lattice is a poset whose elements all have unique LUBs and GLBs.

#### Denning's Axioms
> Security levels form a lattice.

- A security level is a pair (clearance/classification, category)

### Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model

Objective: Information cannot flow downwards. This implies:
1. No read up
2. No write down

The BLP policy has two parts to achieve this goal.

1. Simple Security Policy (Read)
    - Subject $s$ can read object $o\iff L(s)\geq L(o)$.
    - This is the "no read up" rule.
1. *-Property (Write)
    - Subject $s$ can write object $o\iff L(s)\leq L(o)$.
    - This is the "no write down" rule.


---

## Integrity Policies and Hybrid Policies

### Biba model

Objective: Information cannot flow upwards. This implies:
1. No read down
2. No write up

#### General Formal

- $S$: the set of subjects
- $O$: the set of Objects
- $I$: the set of integrity levels
- $i(s)\in I$: integrity level of $s$ where $s\in S$
- $i(o)\in I$: integrity level of $o$ where $o\in O$
- $s\: \underline{r}\: o$: $s$ can read $o$
- $s\: \underline{w}\: o$: $s$ can write $o$
- $s\: \underline{x}\: s$: $s$ can execute $s$

#### Strict Integrity Policy

#### Low-Water-Mark Policy
1. Subject Low-Water-Mark Policy
1. Object Low-Water-Mark Policy

#### Information Transfer Path

### Combining Biba and BLP

1. What if they are exactly reversed
1. What if they are exactly the same

### Chinese Wall Policy (Hybird Policy)

- Place non-conflicting objects inside walls
- Each analyst can only access objects inside a walls
- History-based access control

#### Organization of Objects
- Objects
    - Sanitized objects: Public information that never results in conflicts of interests.
    - Unsanitized objects: Everyting else
- Company dataset (CD)
- Conflict of interest class (COI)
- One special CD in one special COI for all sanitized objects.

### CW-Simple Security Conditions
- Initially, a subject can read any CD in any COI
- Once the subject has read any CD in a COI, he/she can only read 
    - within the same CD, or
    - another COI

### CW-*-Property
A subject $s$ can write to $o$ iff both hold:
1. $s$ can read $o$
2. All $s$ can read are 
    - either within $o$'s CD, 
    - or sanitized.

---

## Design principles

### Principles of security design
- Simplicity
- Restriction

#### Least privilege
- A subject should be given only those information/privileges necessary to complete its task.

#### Fail-Safe Defaults
- Default action is to deny access unless access privileges are granted explicitly to a subject.
- If action fails, it should undo the actions before it terminates.

#### Economy of Mechanism
- Keep security mechanism as simple as possible.

#### Complete Mediation
- Check every access, don't cache or rely on previous permissions.

#### Open Design
- Security should not depend on secrecy of design or implementation.

#### Separation of privilege
- Rquire multiple conditions/subjects to grant privilge.

#### Least Common Mechanism
- Mechanisms/resouces should not be shared.

#### Psychological Acceptability
- Security mechanisms should not add to the difficulty of accessing resource.


### UNIX Security

1. UID, `/etc/passwd`
1. GID, `/etc/group`
1. The Superuser


---

## Authentication and Identity

### Basic concept

- Authentication: to prove an Identity
    - Strong authentication
        - Without transmitting password over Network (then over what?)
        - Or, multi-_**factor**_ authentication
            - At least two of the following factors.
            - If only password and PIN, it's only one factor.
- Factors
    - What the user know: password, PIN
    - What the user has: ID card, ticket
    - What the user is: figerprint, iris, DNA
- Attach
    - Active: password guessing, cracking password hashes, authentication replay, etc.
    - Passive: password sniffing, etc.

### Password Security

- Basic Model (two stages)
    - Registration
    - Login
- Password storage
    - Why not plaintext password
        - The password file could be accessed by insider/outsider
    - Why not the encrypted password
        - Server has to store the key. If the key is lost, same problem as plaintext password
    - Hash (three properties)
        - One-Way
        - Fixed-length output
            - Cannot guess password length
            - Storage efficiency
        - [Collision-resistant](https://lingt-xyz.gitbook.io/inse6110/hash-1/hash)
            - Weak: Given $x$, to find a 2nd-preimage $x'$ where $x'≠x$ such that $h(x')=h(x)$.
                - Given a password, infeasible to find another password such that their hashes are the same. 
            - Strong
                - Most attacks are all about string collision, so passwords are still safe.
                - But dictionary attacks do.
- Dictionary Attacks
    - Two ways
        - Online
            - Compile a dictionary of possible passwords, sorted in likelihood of passwords
            - Try to login with passwords in dictionary
        - Offline
            - Download password file from server
            - Compute hashes of dictionary to try to find a match
    - Time Memory Tradeoff
        - Pre-compute all hashes: faster $O(\log{n})$, but need more space $O(n)$
        - Compute on the fly: slower $O(n)$, but less space $O(1)$
            - $O(n)$ because cannot do binary search
        - In-between: time memory tradeoff method

- Time Memory Tradeoff
    - Assumptions
        - All passwords are three charachters
        - All hashes are also three characters
    - Denote $h^t(abc)=\underbrace{h(h(h\ldots h}_{t}(abc)))$
    - Compute the table ($m\times (t+1)$)

        | $abc$      | $h(abc)$   | $h(h(abc))$ | $$\ldots$$ | $$\ldots$$ | $h^{t-1}(h(abc))$ | $h^{t}(h(abc))$ |
        |------------|------------|-------------|------------|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
        | $abd$      | $h(abd)$   | $h(h(abd))$ | $$\ldots$$ | $$\ldots$$ | $h^{t-1}(h(abd))$ | $h^{t}(h(abd))$ |
        | $cbd$      | $h(cbd)$   | $h(h(cbd))$ | $$\ldots$$ | $$\ldots$$ | $h^{t-1}(h(cbd))$ | $h^{t}(h(cbd))$ |
        | $$\ldots$$ | $$\ldots$$ | $$\ldots$$  | $$\ldots$$ | $$\ldots$$ | $$\ldots$$        | $$\ldots$$      |
        | $$\ldots$$ | $$\ldots$$ | $$\ldots$$  | $$\ldots$$ | $$\ldots$$ | $$\ldots$$        | $$\ldots$$      |
        | $$foo$$    | $h(foo)$   | $h(h(foo))$ | $$\ldots$$ | $$\ldots$$ | $h^{t-1}(h(foo))$ | $h^{t}(h(foo))$ |

    - Suppose we choose $m\times t \geq {26}^{3}=17000$, say $100\times 170$
