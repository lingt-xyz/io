INSE 6120: Operating Systems Security

## Outline
* Instructor: Prof. Mohammad Mannan
* Zoom: [INSE6120 2021 Winter, Tuesdays, 17:45–20:15](https://concordia-ca.zoom.us/j/7745054259)
* Email: : m.mannan@concordia.ca
* Office:
    * Tuesdays from 10:00–11:00
* Course Description: 
> The course introduces concepts, methodologies, techniques, tools and research problems in network security. Methods used in the design and analysis of security protocols, as well as an introduction
to some prominent/example cryptographic protocols will be presented. We will address the issue of network security policies, authentication and authorization services. In addition, we will address
issues such as botnets, darknets and network security monitoring.
> The following topics will be covered (a subset of them): Cryptographic protocols, authentication protocols, key distributions protocols, e-commerce security protocols, security protocol properties: authentication, secrecy, integrity, availability, non-repudiation, atomicity, certified delivery,
crypto-protocol attacks, security protocols design, implementation and analysis. OSI security architecture, models and architectures for network security, authentication using Kerberos and X.509,
email security (PGP, S/MIME), IP security, IPv6, web security, SSL/TLS, virtual private networks, firewalls (screening routers, packet filtering, firewall architecture and theory, implementations and
maintenance, proxy servers), content filtering, denial of service attacks, wireless networks security, network security policies, intrusion detection, host-based IDS, network based IDS, misuse detection methods, anomaly detection methods, intrusion detection in distributed systems, intrusion
detection in wireless ad hoc networks.
