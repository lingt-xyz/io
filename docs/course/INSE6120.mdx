INSE 6120: Cryptographic Protocols and Network Security

## Outline
* Instructor: Prof. Mohammad Mannan
* Zoom: [INSE6120 2021 Winter, Tuesdays, 17:45–20:15](https://concordia-ca.zoom.us/j/7745054259)
* Email: m.mannan@concordia.ca
* Office:
    * Tuesdays from 10:00–11:00
* Course Description: 
    1. The course introduces concepts, methodologies, techniques, tools and research problems in network security. Methods used in the design and analysis of security protocols, as well as an introduction to some prominent/example cryptographic protocols will be presented. We will address the issue of network security policies, authentication and authorization services. In addition, we will address issues such as botnets, darknets and network security monitoring.
    2. The following topics will be covered (a subset of them): 
        - Cryptographic protocols, 
        - authentication protocols, 
        - key distributions protocols, 
        - e-commerce security protocols, 
        - security protocol properties: authentication, secrecy, integrity, availability, non-repudiation, atomicity, 
        - certified delivery, 
        - crypto-protocol attacks, 
        - security protocols design, implementation and analysis. 
        - OSI security architecture, models and architectures for network security, 
        - authentication using Kerberos and X.509, 
        - email security (PGP, S/MIME), 
        - IP security, IPv6, 
        - web security, SSL/TLS, 
        - virtual private networks, 
        - firewalls (screening routers, packet filtering, firewall architecture and theory, implementations and maintenance, proxy servers), 
        - content filtering, denial of service attacks, 
        - wireless networks security, 
        - network security policies, 
        - intrusion detection, 
        - host-based IDS, 
        - network based IDS, 
        - misuse detection methods, 
        - anomaly detection methods, 
        - intrusion detection in distributed systems, 
        - intrusion detection in wireless ad hoc networks.
* Notation
    - $E_A(M)$: Public key encryption of message $M$ with entity $A$'s public key
    - $\{M\}_k$: Symmetric key encryption with shared key $K$
    - $MAC_k(M)$: $MAC$ of message $M$ under shared key $K$
    - $Sig_A(M)$: Digital signature of $M$, generated by $A$

## 1. Cryptographic Protocols: Definitions, Properties, Types

### Cryptographic protocols
1. A protocol is a set of rules or conventions that overn the exchange of information between two or more principals (computers, hosts, humans).
1. Cryptographic protocols are a subclass of protocols that use cryptographic techniques to achieve **security objectives** such as authentication, key establishment, anonymity...

#### Steps in cryptographic protocols
1. A communication step transfers a message from on principal to another
    * Multiple parties might be involved
1. A computation step updates a priniciple's internal state
    * The computation results may be used only be the principal, or sent to other parties

#### Examples of deployed protocols
- SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
- TLS (Transport Layer Security)
- IPSec
- PGP
- Blockchain-based protocols
- E-voting
- Kerberos

#### Assumptions of protocols
- The protocol used is **not** a secret
- All specifications/parameters are publicly known

### Security stack

### Difficulties in security protocol design/analysis

- Properties/goals are sometimes more subtle than apparent
- Capturing assumptions/thread model is non-trivial
    - e.g.: assume that a password is always randomly generated
    - e.g.: system is not compromised
- Hostile operating environment
    - e.g.: system is exposed to attackers
- Concurrent runs

### Adversay attributes
1. objectives: what is available in the system (assets requiring special protection)
2. methods: what attack techniques would be used
3. capabilities: what the attackers have, such as computing resources (CPU, storage, bandwidth), skills, knowledge, personnel, opportunity (e.g., physical access to target machines)
4. funding level: what is the cost to attack (this influences attacker determination, methods and capabilities)
5. outsider vs. insider
    - An attack launched without any prior special access to the target network is an outsider attack. 
    - In contrast, insiders and insider attacks originate from parties having some starting advantage, e.g., employees with physical access or network credentials as legitimate users. 

#### Adversary groups
- Foreign intelligence (including government-funded agencies)
- Cyber-terrorists or politically-motivated adversaries
- Industrial espionage agents (perhaps funded by competitors)
- Organized crime (groups)
- Lesser criminals and crackers (i.e., individuals who break into computers)
- Malicious insiders (including disgruntled employees)
    - disgruntled: angry or dissatisfied
- Non-malicious employees (often security-unaware)

#### Adversary goals
- Learn confidential information (data confidentiality)
    - E.g. intercept passwords during login
- Modify data in transit (data integrity)
    - E.g. change recipient account in bank transfer
- Impersonate other participants (data origin/entity authentication)
    - E.g. send a phishing email
- Block certain communication (data/service availability)
    - E.g. prevent a Bitcoin transaction

#### Security goals

### Design security protocols by an example

1. Key establishment protocol
    - exchange a **session** key ($K_{AB}$) between two users: Alice & Bob
    - Parties in a protocol are also termed as "Principals"
    - Assume we have three parties: Alice ($A$), Bob $($B) and a trusted server ($S$)
    - $S$ will generate $K_{AB}$ and distribute it to $A$ & $B$
1. Protocal goals: At the end of the protocol run, we should achieve:
    - G1: $A$ & $B$ must know $K_{AB}$
    - G2: $K_{AB}$ must not be known to anyone else except $(A, B, S)$
    - G3: $A$ & $B$ must know that $K_{AB}$ is a fresh key (newly generated for the current session only)
1. Protocol 1.1
    - Compact form
        1. $A\rightarrow S: A, B$: I'm $A$, I would like to talk with $B$
        2. $S\rightarrow A: K_{AB}$
        3. $A\rightarrow B: K_{AB}$
    - Achieved: G1
    - Assumption - confidentiality
