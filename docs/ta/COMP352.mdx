## Traversals

### Question

:::info
**Problem** : Draw a tree $$T$$ given that:

* A pre-order traversal of $$T$$ yields: $$E\ K\ D\ M\ J\ G\ I\ A\ C\ F\ H\ B\ L$$.
* A post-order traversal of $$T$$ yields: $$D\ J\ I\ G\ A\ M\ K\ F\ L\ B\ H\ C\ E$$.
:::

:::tip
Use divide and conquer approach.
:::

1. `pre-order`yields $$E\ K\ D\ M \cdots\Rightarrow E$$ is the root of $$T$$, $$K$$ is the first child of $$T$$.
2. `post-order` yields$$\cdots B\ H\ C\ E\Rightarrow E$$is the root of $$T$$, $$C$$ is the last child of $$T$$.
3. If $$E$$ has another child which is in-between $$K$$ and $$C$$, it should be $$D$$ because of `pre-order`. However, $$D$$ is the first node in `post-order`, so$$D$$cannot be in-between $$K$$ and $$C$$.
4. $$E$$ only has a left child $$K$$ and a right child $$C\Rightarrow$$
   * From `pre-oder`, $$K\ D\ M\ J\ G\ I\ A$$ is a left-sub-tree; $$C\ F\ H\ B\ L$$ is a right-sub-tree.
   * From `post-order`, $$D\ J\ I\ G\ A\ M\ K$$ is a left-sub-tree; $$F\ L\ B\ H\ C$$ is a right-sub-tree.

:::caution
We have conquered the root $$E$$. Now, this problem was divided into two sub-problems:

* **Problem 1**: Draw a tree $$T_1$$ where
  * Pre-order traversal yields: $$K\ D\ M\ J\ G\ I\ A$$.
  * Post-order traversal yields: $$D\ J\ I\ G\ A\ M\ K$$.
* **Problem 2**: Draw a tree $$T_2$$ where
  * Pre-order traversal yields: $$C\ F\ H\ B\ L$$.
  * Post-order traversal yields: $$F\ L\ B\ H\ C$$.
:::

**Problem 1**: Draw a tree $$T_1$$ where

* Pre-order traversal yields: $$K\ D\ M\ J\ G\ I\ A$$.
* Post-order traversal yields: $$D\ J\ I\ G\ A\ M\ K$$.
:::

We follow the same approach as what we did on$$E$$.

1. $$K$$ is the root, $$D$$ is the first child of $$K$$ and $$M$$ is the last child of $$K$$.
   * $$K$$ has no more child because if it has a child $$K_C$$, then $$K_C$$ would be in-between $$D$$ and $$M$$ in `pre-order` traversal.
2. Furthermore, we should know that $$M\ J\ G\ I\ A$$ is a right-sub-tree of $$T_1$$ because of `pre-order`. That is, if $$D$$ has children, they should be in-between $$D$$ and $$M$$ in `pre-order` traversal.

:::caution
We have conquered the root$$K$$and its left child$$D$$. Now the **Problem 1** was divided into a smaller problem:

* **Problem 1.1**: Draw a tree $$T_{11}$$ where
  * Pre-order traversal yields: $$M\ J\ G\ I\ A$$.
  * Post-order traversal yields: $$J\ I\ G\ A\ M$$.
:::

:::info
**Problem 1.1**: Draw a tree $$T_{11}$$ where

* Pre-order traversal yields: $$M\ J\ G\ I\ A$$.
* Post-order traversal yields: $$J\ I\ G\ A\ M$$.
:::

1. $$M$$ is the root of $$T_{11}$$, $$J$$ is the first child, $$A$$ is the last child.
   * If $$M$$ has another child which is in-between $$J$$ and $$A$$, it should be $$G$$ because of `pre-oder`.
     * If $$G$$ is not a child of $$M$$, then it can only be a child of $$J$$ because $$G$$ is before $$A$$ in `pre-order` . However, $$G$$ cannot be a child of $$J$$ because in `post-order` $$G$$ is after $$J$$.
     * So we know $$G$$ is a child of $$M$$; that is, $$M$$ has three children $$J,G,A$$.
   * What about $$I$$?
     * From $$G\ I\ A$$in `pre-order` we know $$I$$ can only be a child of $$G$$. This conclusion is consistent with the fact that in `post-order` they are $$I\ G\ A$$.

:::info
**Problem 2**: Draw a tree $$T_2$$ where

* Pre-order traversal yields: $$C\ F\ H\ B\ L$$.
* Post-order traversal yields: $$F\ L\ B\ H\ C$$.
:::

1. $$C$$is the root of $$T_{2}$$, $$F$$is the first child, $$H$$is the last child.
   * This is the same case as Problem 1: $$F$$is the only left-sub-tree of $$T_{2}$$ and $$H\ B\ L$$ is the right-sub-tree.

![](/assets/ta/COMP352/p_t_5.png)

:::caution
We have conquered the root$$C$$and its left child $$F$$. Now the problem 2 was divided into a smaller problem:

* **Problem 2.1**: Draw a tree $$T_{21}$$ where
  * Pre-order traversal yields: $$H\ B\ L$$.
  * Post-order traversal yields: $$L\ B\ H$$.
:::

:::info
**Problem 2.1**: Draw a tree $$T_{21}$$ where

* Pre-order traversal yields: $$H\ B\ L$$.
* Post-order traversal yields: $$L\ B\ H$$.
:::

1. $$H$$ is the root of $$T_{21}$$, the first child is $$B$$, and the last child is $$B$$.
2. So $$H$$ only has one child $$B$$, then $$L$$ can only be a child of $$B$$.

## Shortest paths

### Problem Define

Given a weighted graph and two vertices $$u$$ and $$v$$, we want to find a path of minimum total weight between $$u$$ and $$v$$.

:::info
Types of shortest paths problems

* Single-Source shortest-paths problem
* Single-destination shortest-paths problem
* Single-pair shortest-path problem
* All-pairs shortest-paths problem
:::

### Shortest Path Properties

1. A sub-path of a shortest path is itself a shortest path.
2. There is a tree of shortest paths from a start vertex to all the other vertices.

## Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Dijkstra’s algorithm solves single-source shortest-paths problem. It is a type of greedy algorithm.

### Assumptions of Dijkstra's Algorithm

1. The graph is connected.
2. The edges are undirected.
3. The edge weights are **non-negative**.

### Edge Relaxation

Edge relaxation is a helper function.

:::info
Stretch it first, then relax, so it's called relaxation.
:::

1. Let $$D[u]$$ denote the length of the best path from $$v$$ to $$u$$ that could have been found **so far**.
2. Initially, $$D[v]=0$$, and $$D[u]=\infty$$ for each other vertex $$u$$ in the graph. 
3. $$D[u]$$ will afterwards be updated if a better path is found that results in a smaller shortest path value to $$u$$. This step is relaxation.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

#### Two sets

* $$C$$ contains the vertices which we have already found the shortest paths to them.
  * After a vertex was put in$$C$$,  we should never update it again, because the solution has been found at the moment it was put in.
* $$S$$ contains the vertices connecting to the vertices in $$C$$.

#### Steps

1. Initially,$$C=\emptyset, S=\{v\}$$, where $$v$$ is the starting vertex.
2. Do edge relaxation initialization; that is, $$D[v]=0$$ and $$D[u]=\infty$$ for each other vertex $$u$$.
3. Select the vertex $$s$$ in $$S$$ which has the shortest path to$$v$$.
   1. Move $$s$$ to $$C$$.
   2. For every vertex which is connected to $$s$$ and not in $$C$$, do edge relaxation.
   3. Add these connected vertices to $$C$$.
4. Repeating step $$#3$$ util $$S=\emptyset$$.

### Example

1. $$C=\emptyset, S=\{A\}$$
2. $$D[A]=0, D[B]=\infty,D[C]=\infty,D[D]=\infty,D[E]=\infty,D[F]=\infty$$
3. Move the vertex $$A$$ from $$S$$ to $$C$$ because $$D[A]$$ is the smallest one among all vertices in $$S$$.
   * $$C=\{A\},S=\emptyset$$
   * Relax $$D[B]$$ and $$D[C]$$ because $$B,C$$ are connected to $$A$$ and they are **not** in the set $$C$$.
     * $$D[B]=2<\infty$$
     * $$D[C]=1<\infty$$
   * Put $$B,C$$ in the set $$S$$.
     * $$C=\{A\},S=\{B,C\}$$
4. Move the vertex $$C$$ from $$S$$ to $$C$$ because $$D[C]<D[B]$$
   *  $$C=\{A,C\},S=\{B\}$$
   * Relax $$D[D],D[E],D[F]$$ because $$D,E,F$$ are connected to the vertex $$C$$ and they are **not** in the set $$C$$.
     * $$D[D]=D[C]+e_{CD}=4<\infty$$
     * $$D[E]=D[C]+e_{CE}=7<\infty$$
     * $$D[F]=D[C]+e_{CF}=8<\infty$$
   * Put $$D,E,F$$ in the set $$S$$.
     * $$C=\{A,C\},S=\{B,D,E,F\}$$
5. Move the vertex $$B$$ from $$S$$ to $$C$$ because $$D[B]<D[D]<D[E]<D[F]$$.
   * $$C=\{A,C,B\},S=\{D,E,F\}$$
   * Relax $$D[D],D[E],D[F]$$ because $$D,E,F$$ are connected to $$B$$ and they are **not** in the set $$C$$.
     * $$D[D]=D[B]+e_{BD}=5>4$$
      :::info
      $$D[D]$$ should not be updated because its previous value is smaller.
      :::
     * $$D[E]=D[B]+e_{BE}=6<7$$
     * $$D[F]=D[B]+e_{BF}=9>8$$
   * No more vertices put in the set $$S$$.
     * $$C=\{A,C,B\},S=\{D,E,F\}$$
6. Move $$D$$from $$S$$ to $$C$$ because $$D[D]<D[E]<D[F]$$.
   * $$C=\{A,C,B,D\},S=\{E,F\}$$
   * Relax $$D[F]$$.
     * $$D[F]=D[D]+e_{DF}=6<8$$
   * No more vertices put in the set $$S$$.
     * $$C=\{A,C,B,D\},S=\{E,F\}$$
7. Move $$E$$ or $$F$$ to $$C$$ because $$D[E]=D[F]$$
   * $$C=\{A,C,B,D,E\},S=\{F\}$$
   * Relax $$D[F]$$.
     * $$D[F]=D[E]+e_{EF}=12>6$$❌ 
   * No more vertices put in the set$$S$$.
     * $$C=\{A,C,B,D,E\},S=\{F\}$$
8.  Move $$F$$ to $$C$$, now $$S=\emptyset$$.
