## Introduction

### What is computer security?
* Physical security and information security

### Overview of all perspectives of system security

* Objectives
    * Confidentiality
        * What: keeping data and resources hidden
        * How: encryption
    * Integrity
        * What: data integrity and origin integrity (authentication)
        * How: digital signature and ?
    * Availability
        * What: enabling access to data and resources

* Classes of Threats
    * Disclosure: snooping (sniffing) -> confidentiality
    * Deception: modification, spoofing (masquerading), repudiation of origin, denial of receipt -> Integrity
    * Disruptoin: modification -> Availability
    * Usurpation: modification, spoofing, delay, denial of service. It's a combination of all. -> confidentiality, integrity, availability

* Policies and mechanisms
    * Defines "security" for the system: what can do, what cannot do
    * Mechanisms enforece policies
        * Technical or procedural
    * OM-AM (by Ravi Sandhu)
        * Objective: confidentiality
        * Model: ACM
        * Architecutre: Client-Server
    * Ways for achieving security
        * Prevention
        * Detection
        * Recovery
    * Trust and assumptions
        * this is underlie all aspects of security
        * For policies, unambiguously partiion system states, correctly capture security requirements
        * For mechanisms: assume to ?
    * Types of Mechanisms
        * Three cases.
        * Policy should cover security.

* The role of trust, assurance, operational issues, human issues
    * Assurance
        * Specification
    * Operational issues
        * Cost-Benefit analysis
        * Risk analysis
            * Should we protect something
            * How much should we protect is
        * Laws and Customs
    * Human Issues
        * Organizational Problems
            * Power and responsibility
            * Financial benefits
        * People problems
            * Outsiders and insiders
            * Social engineering: get information from person to go further
